        Effective collaboration begins with a clear understanding of common goals and objectives. Defining roles and
        responsibilities is key to preventing work overlap and conflict. Regular meetings and stand-ups help keep
        everyone updated on current progress and emerging issues.

        Collaboration tools such as version control systems, issue trackers, and messaging platforms play an important
        role in coordinating team efforts. They allow programmers to collaborate effectively, even if they are
        physically located in different parts of the world.

        In our team, we used an approach in which everyone was equal and had voting rights. Collaboration and teamwork
        consisted of daily meetings, as well as joint code reviews. If someone couldnâ€™t cope with a task, the team
        happily came to the rescue. Discrord, canban, github were involved in the team work.
